# Pixels: The Game

For HSA Band's Winter Concert performing the piece Pixels by Randall Standridge.

## About

This game was made as an accompaniment of our performance during the winter concert of my school's band. This game is based off the piece "Pixels" by Randall Standridge. I originally just used Godot to make creating a video way easier, but eventually I wanted to work on it more to make it more of an actual game. So, here it is!
